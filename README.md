# Comparative-Cognition-R-scripts

There are five primary R scripts in this repository related to comparative cognition hand score data analysis:
Comparative Cognition Numerosity Cowlog Analysis.Rmd and 
Comparative Cognition Numerosity Analysis of Cowlog Data Part II.Rmd
Comparative Cognition Numerosity Analysis of Cowlog Data Part III.Rmd
Comparative Cognition Numerosity Analysis of Cowlog Data Part IV.Rmd
Comparative Cognition Numerosity Analysis of Cowlog Data Part V.Rmd

The first script takes the 300 or so cowlog score sheets from numerosity and makes a summary data frame from them. 
The second takes the resulting data frame and pulls out useful graphs and stats (all related to numerosity).
The third script adds in the detour maze information, analyzes it, and compares it to numerosity. 
The fourth script incorporates shuttlebox information. 
The fifth script analyzes all the assays as a single dataframe. 
Additional scripts perform statistical analysis and generate figures. 
A cowlog score sheet looks like this:

time	code	class

31.65	 top left thigmo	1
33.725	 center	1
35.325	 top mirror	1
